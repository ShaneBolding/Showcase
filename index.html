    <h1 style = "text-align:center; font-weight: bold; font-size: 25px;">Welcome to the Showcase</h1>
    <p style = "font-size: 18px;">Throughout university I have made and designed copious amounts of devices, software, models, and circuits that I would like to show you.
	I figured this website I made would be a great way to do so. I find that a website is more palatable and quicker to look at 
	demonstrations either through videos or through pictures. So, thank you for browsing
	and enjoy! To your left or above will be some buttons of what you may be interested in that will take you to a page where you may find these videos/pictures
	each with a short description.</p>

    <h1 style = "text-align:center; font-weight: bold; font-size: 25px;">Things I Have Done</h1>
    <p style = "font-size: 18px;">Somethings just do not deserve their own webpage but are important nonetheless
	so here is a quick list of some of the things I have done that may help you get to know me a bit more. And if you want even more here is a link
	to my <a href="BlackResume.pdf" download>RESUME</a>. </p>

    <ul>
	<li> <p style = "font-size: 18px;"> <b>Tutoring -</b> I tutored for a part time job throughout my last year in university and 
	have help countless study groups throughout my entire career through university. </li> 

	<li> <p style = "font-size: 18px;"> <b>Languages -</b> I took three years of Spanish in high school and am still a bit familiar
	with the grammar and word. I do not think it would be that hard to pick it up again. I taught myself Japanese and am comfortable
	with the language. I also taught myself a few coding languages like HTML, C++, Java, Javascript, and MatLab. </li>

	<li> <p style = "font-size: 18px;"> <b>Robotics -</b> For my senior capstone project my team and I decided to make a robot for
	the IEEE southeast robotics competition. This competition was to create a robot that stacked Lego blocks in a standardized playing
	field. We were going to go to competition after getting the robot to stack up to 13 blocks, but it was canceled due to the 
	Covid-19 pandemic. I was the sole coder for this project. This project was voted best project by our university for Spring 2020 and a video can be found 
	<a href="https://uwf.edu/hmcse/departments/electrical-and-computer-engineering/student-projects/capstone-project-showcase/">here</a> 
	or on youtube
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_UWNbkTSuU">here</a>.</li>
